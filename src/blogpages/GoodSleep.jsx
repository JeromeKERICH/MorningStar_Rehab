          <h2>Why Is Sleep Important?</h2>
          <p>
            Sleep is not just about resting; it is a biological necessity that affects every aspect of health. Here are some key reasons why quality sleep is essential:
          </p>
          <p>
            Sleep plays a vital role in cognitive processes such as memory consolidation, problem-solving, and decision-making. A well-rested brain enhances focus, creativity, and learning ability. Additionally, good sleep helps regulate emotional responses, supports mental health, and strengthens the immune system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. Quality sleep promotes cardiovascular health, balances hormones, and supports metabolism, reducing the risk of weight gain and chronic diseases.

          <h2>The Effects of Poor Sleep Hygiene</h2>
          <p>
            Poor sleep hygiene can lead to a variety of negative effects on both physical and mental health. Persistent tiredness and low energy are common, along with difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and reduced problem-solving skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            A weakened immune system increases the risk of frequent illnesses, while disrupted hormones can lead to weight gain and unhealthy eating habits. Additionally, poor sleep is associated with anxiety, depression, and mood swings, as well as an increased risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension.
          </p>
          <p>
            Addressing poor sleep hygiene is essential to avoid these adverse effects and improve overall well-being.
