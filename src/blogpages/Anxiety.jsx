                    <p>
                        Stress is the body's response to external pressures, while anxiety is a feeling of fear or apprehension about the future. Both can manifest physically, emotionally, and behaviorally, affecting overall well-being.

                        1. Practice deep breathing exercises to calm your mind and body. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth.

                        2. Engage in regular physical activity, such as walking, yoga, or dancing. Exercise releases endorphins, which help reduce stress.
