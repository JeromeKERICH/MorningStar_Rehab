            <h2>Understanding CBT</h2>
            <p>
                Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a structured, goal-oriented form of psychotherapy that helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns. It is widely used to treat anxiety, depression, and other mental health challenges by focusing on the connection between thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

                <h2>How CBT Works</h2>
                <p>
                    CBT operates on the principle that our thoughts influence our feelings and behaviors. By identifying and challenging distorted thinking, individuals can develop healthier perspectives and coping mechanisms. Here are some key techniques used in CBT:
                </p>
                <h3>1. <strong>Cognitive Restructuring</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    This involves identifying negative thoughts, examining their validity, and replacing them with balanced alternatives. For example, changing "I always fail" to "I can learn from mistakes and improve."
                </p>
                <h3>2. <strong>Behavioral Activation</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Encourages individuals to engage in positive activities that improve mood and reduce avoidance behaviors.
                </p>
                <h3>3. <strong>Thought Records</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    A tool for tracking negative thoughts, associated emotions, and evidence for and against these thoughts to develop more rational perspectives.
                </p>
                <h3>4. <strong>Mindfulness Techniques</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Helps individuals stay present and observe thoughts without judgment, reducing the impact of negative thinking.
