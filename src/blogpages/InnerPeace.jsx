          <h2>Understanding Prayer and Meditation</h2>
          <p>While prayer and meditation are often linked, they are distinct practices that complement each other beautifully.</p>
          <h3>What is Prayer?</h3>
          <p>Prayer is a conversation with God, the universe, or a higher power. It is a way to express gratitude, seek guidance, confess burdens, and surrender worries. Prayer can be spoken, written, or even silent. It is deeply personal and can be structured (such as religious prayers) or free-flowing.</p>
          
          <h3>What is Meditation?</h3>
          <p>Meditation is the practice of focusing the mind and calming the body to attain a state of awareness, peace, and clarity. It often involves techniques such as deep breathing, visualization, and mindfulness to center one’s thoughts and emotions. Unlike prayer, which involves speaking or communicating, meditation emphasizes listening and stillness.</p>
